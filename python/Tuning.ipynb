    "# Musical Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand why we generally use 12 equally spaced notes in musical scales, I put together some visualisations which show the notes/intervals against dissonance/consonance curves. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python code used to generate the plots can be found [here](https://github.com/pigatron-industries/xen_quantizer/tree/main/python)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's generally known that the most consonant intervals in music are where the difference in frequencies of 2 notes played together can be expressed as simple ratios. e.g. an octave is a ratio of 2/1, which means the root note with frequency of say 440Hz is played at the same time as a note with double the frequency, 880Hz. A perfect fifth is the ratio of 3/2 which puts the note frequency at 660Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using frequency ratios it's easier to visualize this on a linear scale where the root note is a 0 and the octave is at 1. Then 2 octaves would be 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ratios can be converted using the base 2 logarithm, e.g the perfect fifth: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$log_2(3/2) = 0.585$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert from octaves back to ratio you can raise 2 to the power of the value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2^{0.585} = 1.5 = 3/2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To get from an octave value to a frequency, the following equation can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f = a2^{v}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$ is the root frequency and $v$ is the octave value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuning is often expressed in cents, where each semitone in the 12 tone scale is divided by 100. Octaves can easily be converted to cents by multiplying by 1200:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0.585 \\times 1200 = 702$$\n",

    "## Dissonance Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "The curve below shows the dissonance of 2 sine waves played at increasing frequency intervals. The curve is based on experimental results by Plomp and Levelt in the paper [Tonal Consonance and Critical Bandwidth](https://www.mpi.nl/world/materials/publications/levelt/Plomp_Levelt_Tonal_1965.pdf). It shows that consonance is greatest when the 2 sine waves are at the same frequency. As the frequency interval increases it become more dissonant, after a level of maximum dissonance it then drops off again to become gradually more consonant."
